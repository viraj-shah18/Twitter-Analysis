## Installation
run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This would install most of the dependencies (except twint - pip version is an old version of twint)

## Running
The program takes single argument as name or hashtag of any conference that have taken place. 
(A point to take care is particular acronym for conference can also be used elsewhere - example ACL is name of conference as well as football league)

For example  ```python main.py '<#EMNLP2020>'```
